I developed this after testing and using several alternative FOSS Launchers, the most influential
was [Silverfish](https://github.com/stanipintjuk/Silverfish), from which I borrowed some ideas and 
some code (mainly widget and package categorization code).  I decided to develop my own instead 
of adding to it because we have different design goals for a few important features (ie single vs 
multiple widgets, unified homescreen vs app-drawer, etc)  If this launcher doesn't suit you, I 
encourage you try it!  I've also borrowed some icon-pack handling code from the 
[KISS Launcher](https://github.com/Neamar/KISS)
Also, great thanks to @colbycdev. Help him out at https://GitHub.com/innonetlife.
